## The Question
Does public policy affect homeowner's mortgage payment decision?<br>

We exam the following termination events and look for patterns related to the loan's geographical origin.
<ul type="disc">
	<li>borrower foreclose within a year/after a year</li>
	<li>borrower make prepayment to exit the mortgage within a year/within one to five years/beyond five years</li>
	<li>short sale </li>
	<li>loan modification</li>
</ul>
  
Borrower' payment decision involves both long-term and short-term consideration. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Long-term: permanent income hypothesis tells us that the monthly payment schedule should match the expected income stream. Social security</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
